          <p>
            The AT&T Long Lines Building, located at 33 Thomas Street in Lower
            Manhattan, is one of New York City's most enigmatic skyscrapers.
            Standing at 550 feet (170 meters), this Brutalist structure has no
            windows and was designed to withstand nuclear blasts, making it one
            of the most fortified buildings in the world.
          </p>
          <hr class="custom-line-2" />
          <h2>Architectural Design and Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Designed by architect John Carl Warnecke, the building was completed
            between 1969 and 1974 as a major hub for long-distance telephone
            communications. It was constructed to house AT&T’s switching
            equipment, which required a controlled environment, free from
            natural light, fluctuating temperatures, and external threats. The
            thick concrete walls and lack of windows help to maintain stable
            conditions for telecommunications infrastructure inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            The facade consists of flame-treated Swedish granite panels, giving
            it a monolithic and imposing presence. The structure includes 29
            floors, but due to the immense height of each floor—averaging 18
            feet—it is equivalent in size to a typical 40-story building.
          </p>
          <hr class="custom-line-2" />
          <h2>Inside The Building</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike conventional skyscrapers filled with office spaces, the Long
            Lines Building is primarily a cavernous, industrial facility. The
            majority of the interior consists of vast, open floors filled with
            telephone switching equipment, data servers, and power systems. The
            floors are reinforced to support heavy machinery, and its
            self-sufficient design includes its own water and fuel supplies to
            maintain operations for weeks in case of an emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the interior is highly restricted, with tight security
            measures in place. Employees who have worked inside describe the
            environment as eerily quiet, apart from the constant hum of
            machinery. The air is filtered, and emergency generators ensure the
            building remains operational even in the event of citywide power
            failures.
          </p>

          <h2>The NSA's Alleged Involvement</h2>
          <p>
            In 2013, classified documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward
            Snowden suggested that the AT&T Long Lines Building may be more than
            just a telephone exchange. According to reports by The Intercept,
            the building allegedly houses a top-secret surveillance program
            known as TITANPOINTE, which is believed to be operated by the
            National Security Agency (NSA) in partnership with AT&T.
          </p>
          <p>
            The building's role in global intelligence efforts is suspected to
            involve the interception of phone calls, internet traffic, and other
            forms of communication. Documents revealed that AT&T, through the
            Long Lines Building, may have facilitated the NSA in gathering data
            on foreign and domestic communications, acting as a hub for mass
            surveillance programs. While neither AT&T nor the NSA have confirmed
            these allegations, the secrecy surrounding the building has only
            fueled speculation.
          </p>

          <h2>Cultural Impact and Urban Legends</h2>
          <p>
            The Long Lines Building’s fortress-like design has made it a subject
            of urban legends, conspiracy theories, and pop culture references.
            It has been featured in books, films, and television shows, often
            depicted as a secure government facility or a dystopian stronghold.
            Some theorists claim that deep underground tunnels connect it to
            other parts of the city, though no evidence has confirmed this.
